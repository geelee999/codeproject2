code project 2 
This is the read me file for the september C# class project.
I have created a simple database for the Greater Louisville Bonsai Socities news letter archive.
To display the news letters click on the news letter link and select the edition you would like to read. You can also evaluate the news letter 
by giving your feed back. You can also delete feedback that has been left to demonstrate the crud function
